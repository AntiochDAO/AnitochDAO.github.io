#  AntiochDAO
Digital media files are the modern equivalent of ancient scrolls. They are the artifacts of the post-internet world. They contain the history, culture, and knowledge of our era. AntiochDAO curates and archives important digital media in a decentralized, robust, and economical manner for the benefit of future generations.
## What is it?
AntiochDAO curates and archives important cultural and historical digital media in a decentralized, robust, and economical manner as a public good.

Existing and yet-to-be-made media files are identified and target for archiving by the DAO.

### Types of media
Mostly video and audio streams.

## Why?
- Preserve culturally important and historical media
- Long-term accountability
- Hedge against censorship and biased business practices

## Doesn’t archive.org already do this?
Yes, but we are taking a different approach. This DAO will target media that it determines is important to preserve. Also, we will not focus on instant retrievability of media that is still available from it’s original source. Finally, AntiochDAO will build an archival system that relies on decentralized media, so that it isn’t subject to the pressures to take down important media. Finally, Antioch will be built to preserve media in-perpetuity. As long as filecoin exists, media stored by Antioch will be preserved.

## How?
### Storage
The files are retrieved and stored on filecoin. A searchable index of the files is stored in a decentralized database that can be queried publicly and viewed on a website.

Anyone can ask for a file to be archived, but the DAO will decide whether to do so, depending on the resources the DAO currently has available. The requestor can also pay for the file to be archived by donating enough to cover for perpetual archiving.

When a storage deal is made, funds are loaned to interest bearing accounts. The generated interest is enough to ensure that storage deals can be renewed in perpetuity. See https://twitter.com/jnthnvctr/status/1545401176392437762. Also, talk to Jonathon and get his input.

**Open question: How many instances need to be stored? What is the best long term storage strategy?**

### Retrieval
We will charge a fee for retrieval of stored media. It will be enough to pay the retrieval costs + a fund-raiser. The retrieved media will temporarily be pinned on IPFS, Saturn (https://strn.network/) or another service like that. Due to the length of time retrieval typically takes, it should help dissuaded from requesting media that is otherwise available through the original place it was publication or from another archiving service.

Media that is unavailable from other sources will be prioritized for perpetual pinning.

### Protecting creator rights
We will try to be sensitive to creator rights. If a creator asks us to make their media unavailable, we will do so until the copyright expires. If a creator allows us to distribute their media, they will be entitled to a portion of the retrieval fee that we charge.
